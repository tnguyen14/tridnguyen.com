As a developer at Upstatement, I worked on a custom JavaScript application to prototype a redesign for big regional news website. The app features an infinitely scrolling feed that caters to the power users who want to stay updated with all the news of the day. The feed also includes a content filter to help users who come to the site with a specific topic in mind to easily focus on what they care about.

The prototype features a menu navigation that aims to replace the cluttered navigational structure of the current site and provides users with simpler, more intuitive ways to search for content. Together with a touch-friendly carousel, the menu navigation bridges the gap for users accessing the site from touch devices (such as phones or tablets) while upholds the experience of more traditional, desktop-based browsing.

An interesting challenge while working on this prototype was creating a mechanism for editors to customize how advertisements are displayed on the page. The customization includes the type of ads, the frequency of ads and their starting point on the feed. In addition, it was also critical to the success of the redesign to create a layout that let the ads adapt to different screen sizes. Integrating this responsive ad layout with infinite scroll and content filter was a great exercise of front-end architecture, design and implementation.

After weeks working on the prototype, the biggest insight for me happened when we brought the prototype to test with actual Boston.com users. With diverse user profiles that are typical for site, the feedback helped us re-evaluate assumptions we made in building the prototype, reinforced some decisions about sacrificing content (and clutter) for simplicity, while called into question other novel design ideas that impeded recognition for regular, non-tech savvy users.
