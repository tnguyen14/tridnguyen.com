This project is a website made for a [non-profit organization](http://tinhnguyenlonghoa.org) who is trying to make a difference in the lives of homeless children residing in Long Hoa Orphanage in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

#### Stories told through the lens
Long Hoa needed a place to feature the photo trails of the trips and events organized for the children, in part to attract new volunteers and in part to tell the stories of these young individuals. Starting from a place of compassion and respect, Long Hoa wanted to show how these children live, interact, have fun and grow, just like any other children in Vietnam and around the world.

#### Integration with Facebook
As the Long Hoa volunteer project had been growing its online presence organically through Facebook, the organizer wanted to tap into and integrate with that traffic. The website promotes and reinforces the Facebook page, while the latter channels potential volunteers and engaged audience to the website for more in-depth content.

#### In search of meaning
As Long Hoa continues to grow, push and explore its path to fulfill its mission, I am honored to be a part of this meaningful journey. As much as I revel in the intricacies of JavaScript functions and CSS selectors, projects like Long Hoa are what keep me coming back to web development - as a tool to bridge the gap of information, understanding and compassion.
