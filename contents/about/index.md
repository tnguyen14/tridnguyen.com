I make websites and web applications. I have worked with many Front End technologies, from basic HTML and CSS to complex JavaScript frameworks such as meteor.js. I am a fan of automated workflows - grunt.js and Vagrant have been such powerful tools that significantly improve my productivity, strip away the mundane tasks and allow me to focus on making decisions that are important to the users. On a daily basis, I go from making static site generators using grunt.js, to coding custom themes and functionalities in WordPress, to building JavaScript applications, and everything in between.

What I enjoy the most about making websites is the deep understanding of the clients and their core business strengths. These insights allow me to decide on how to best construct and present information to the users. Long-term relationship with clients is essential in the web industry, and it is one of the most prized facets of my work.
