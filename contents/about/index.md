I make websites and web applications. I have worked with many Front End technologies, from basic HTML and CSS to complicated JavaScript frameworks such as meteor.js. I am a fan of grunt.js and love to learn and play around with devops - using Vagrant for developing WordPress locally was such a joy and breakthrough in my workflow. On a daily basis, I go from making static site generators using grunt.js to coding custom themes and functionalities for WordPress sites and everything web-related in between.

What I enjoy the most about my job is the deep understanding of the clients and their core business strengths. This connection allows me to bring the best content forward in making websites and webapps. It is also like taking a free class in college - you get to discover a huge amount of information and insights through the process. To keep doing good work, I try hard to develop a long-term relationship with clients."
