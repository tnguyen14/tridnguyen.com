There are currently wayyy too many note-taking apps out there, many of them offer very beautiful well-designed interfaces. But with any application, a maturing market calls for simpler ways of doing things. Enter note-taking in your browser!<span class="more"></span>

## Note + Evernote Web Clipper
Here's a simple and quick way to take note that could integrate really well with your current note-taking app. I am a big fan of Evernote, so it is what I use to demonstrate.

A few days ago, this simple trick about ["One Line Browser Notepad"](https://coderwall.com/p/lhsrcq) was circling the Twitterverse with a cool tip of how to transform the Chrome (or whichever modern) browser you use into a notepad.

I thought that was quite cool, but wanted to take a step further to make the whole page looks more appealing. I would be more likely to use this feature if it has a nicer more friendly interface to it. So I decided to make it into a more full-blown website,[Note](http://tridnguyen.com/note).

This page, when used with [Evernote's Web Clipper](http://evernote.com/webclipper/), integrates really well into my current note-taking flow.

A really nice feature is that it has a Note title, which will automatically rewrite the page title. This was done so that when used with Evernote's Web Clipper, the note title is automatically picked up.

The nice lined background for the note part is an adoption from [Lea Verou's CSS3 Patterns](http://lea.verou.me/css3patterns/#lined-paper). This will help the page loads faster than using a background image.
