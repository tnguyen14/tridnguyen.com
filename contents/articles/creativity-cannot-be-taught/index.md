In this video, John Cleese explains how we all can achieve some creativity in our daily life, and does so with a great sense of humor and conviction. This is perhaps one of the best speeches I've listened to this year (and considering that January is only closing, there's not much competition). As one of the commenters said, if this was on TED, it would be one of the most popular one.

Some of the great ideas I gleaned from watching this, although to be honest any sentence said by him in this talk is quote-worthy, including the lightbulb jokes, are that <em>It is easier to do small things we know how to do that are urgent than to do big things that we're unsure of, like thinking</em> and <em>Some of the most creative people are able to stick with a problem longer and deal with the discomfort, than those who are supposed to be "decisive"</em>. These ideas resonate well with me in my daily life.

P/S: You can't help but like a guy who has such a cute and cool website [www.thejohncleese.com](http://www.thejohncleese.com/). The best part is that it was made with WordPress too!
