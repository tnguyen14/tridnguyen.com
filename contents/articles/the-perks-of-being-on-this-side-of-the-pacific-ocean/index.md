[Steph Yiu](https://twitter.com/crushgear) wrote a fantastic blog post about what she considers [The Little Privileges You Get By Living In The USA](http://www.hoppycow.com/post/35126924731/the-little-privileges-you-get-by-living-in-the-usa), some of which I whole-heartedly agree with. These are the thoughts that go in my mind daily and I'm happy someone has so well articulated and published it on the web.

Here's Steph's list of 10 perks, check out the post for her full description of each perk, which I thought were light-hearted, honest and insightful observations.
>1. You can Amazon Prime stuff
>2. You can watch TV on Hulu, and movies on Netflix
>3. You can use the iTunes store
>4. You don't need to worry about spoilers
>5. Brands in magazines? They're real.
>6. You can buy Reese's Pieces
>7. Have stuff to do over the holidays
>8. Britney Spears concerts
>9. The best media the world has to offer.
>10. Vote in the biggest election on the planet.

To this list, I would only add **Listening to Spotify and Pandora**, which have become my staples for music for quite a while now, and **Getting first dibs at product releases** (think Apple and Android phones, Amazon Kindles etc.), though the latter has been improved with every release cycle.

I don't really get the Birtney Spear concerts, but I do think that there are just a whole lot more concerts here in general, not just big name ones, but even small little ones around the community neighborhoods. And unfortunately I can't share Steph's joy in being a part of the election, but I share the sentiment nonetheless.
